	<h2>Documentation Website</h2>
	<p>Dough.js is light and simple so its website follows the all-docs-in-one-long-page stream, divided into chapters, along with small characteristic touches.</p>
	<p>Inspired by cooking books, every chapter has its prominent space with a dough-translated illustration:</p>

	<div class="project-column column"><p>Since the website is a rather long page, it occupies a side menu for navigating to a chapter or a method. The pages are initially hidden for the menu to be easy to review, yet stalling for a second reveals them.</p></div>

	<h2>More About Dough.js</h2>
	<p>Dough.js started as a constantly copied Ditto.js file between my web projects and like most JS libraries today, it supports only modern web browsers, but it's got some nice tricks missing from other libraries:</p>
	<h3>Granular execution</h3>
	<p>Say you've got a <code>var buttons = $(".buttons")</code> object you've just used to collectively <code>removeClass()</code> to its items, and now you want to <code>addClass()</code> to the first item - you'd probably go <code>$(buttons[0]).addClass("active")</code>. Dough.js saves you from creating that extra object and instead you could just <code>buttons.addClass("active", 0)</code>; Every collection-wide method in Dough.js supports that by adding that extra index.</p>
	<h3>Smart CSS Selector Toggling</h3>
	<p>You can't always rely on <code>toggleClass()</code> because sometimes your method is called repeatedly or simultaneously, so you end up having: <pre><code class="code-snippet">if (isCool) {
	// Do things
	$(".button").addClass("active");
} else {
	// Do other things
	$(".button").removeClass("active");
}</code></pre>and repeating yourself only because <code>toggleClass()</code> is a monkey. But Dough.js's version is a good listener so you could tell it explicitly: <pre><code class="code-snippet">if (isCool) {
	// Do things
} else {
	// Do other things
}
$(".button").toggleClass("active", isCool);</code></pre></p>
	<h3>Transitions, animations and transforms</h3>
	<p>Easily act upon a CSS transition finish with <code>$.transitionEnd("transform", button, function() { ... })</code> and translate elements with <code>$(".box").translate(20, 10)</code>. No vendor prefix or callback tracking needed.</p>
