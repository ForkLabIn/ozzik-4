        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p>Ironically we had a rather nice analytics page on Brow.si website for clients to check out, but them clients didn't really visit nor knew about it (product-ish: low engagement), which was pretty bad considering that was the only proof of Brow.si's value.</p>
        <p>The goal was clear and ultimately we decided to go for converting the analytics webpage into a daily/weekly email summary since it's:</p>
        <ol class="project-cues">
            <li class="project-cue project-cue-bullet project-cue-goal">Easier to get into publishers' hands</li>
            <li class="project-cue project-cue-bullet project-cue-goal">More succinct (following the nature of emails)</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Going Static</h2>
        <p>Most data was already existing and visualized on Brow.si dashboard website, hence the task was primarily porting it to an email summary. Since the email was time-based it made no sense to include ever growing stats such as "All Time" counters and so these were removed. Along with them, interactive charts like visitors' geographic data were converted to static alternatives and optimized to include minimal information.</p>

        <h2>Other Tidbits</h2>
        <p>Every metric in the report is followed with a "change" badge for indicating its status compared to past report - whether more tweets were posted on Twitter or a new sharing platform has become popular.</p>
        <p>When viewing the full web summary, hovering over the unsubscribe link animates a silly heart breaking.</p>
